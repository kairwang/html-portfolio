<h1>The Best Movies According to Kai</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>1. Mission Impossible 7</h3>
<h4>My Rating: 9. 3</h4>
<p>One of my favorite action movies and has great prequels. 
    Tom Cruise is also my favorite actor.</p>


<h3>2. The Accountant</h3>
<h4>My Rating: 9.2</h4>
<p>Ben Affleck acts extremely well in this film. I found it
    extremely entertaining and was fascinated watching because
    of how they portrayed autism in this light.</p>


<h3>3. Jack Reacher</h3>
<h4>My Rating: 9.1</h4>
<p>Really cool movie, strong main character. Found out about this 
    after watching the entire show on prime videos, which I would also
    reccomend.</p>
